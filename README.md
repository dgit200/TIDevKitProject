This is simply our code to run the final project. For this project we didn't get to implement as we had hoped due to the fact the confirmation of registration for the TI competition came through late and when we looked to the store our teacher advised that there was only really one type of RFID chip that would work however it was out of our price range so we had to then adapt our project to try and use the motion sensor of the sensor hub to implement. The sensor was how ever very difficult to implement and as we had started so late on that part we just ended up getting the functionality to work.
This code shows how you would have the board lit with buzzer and then turn of the buzzer when you have everything.
